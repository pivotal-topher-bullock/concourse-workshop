== 1st Concourse Pipeline

. Create the file hello.yml using your preffered text editor or IDE.  In this step we are creating a job within a pipeline, rather than running a one-off task:
+
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
jobs:
- name: hello-world
  plan:
  - task: say-hello
    config:
      platform: linux
      image_resource:
        type: docker-image
        source: {repository: ubuntu}
      run:
        path: echo
        args: ["Hello, world!"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. To deploy this pipeline to the concourse server use the fly command to set a pipeline.  In the command below replace <LASTNAME> with your lastname.  This will give your pipeline a unique name so as to not collide with the pipelines of others:
+
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ fly -t demo set-pipeline -p hello-world -c hello.yml
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. You'll note the command informs us that initially our pipeline is in a paused state.  We could unpause from the commandline, but instead we'll unpause and execute the pipeline from the Concourse web UI.

. Select the "main" team to login to and use the credentials previously provided to authenticate

. Lastly, click on your pipeline and then click on and large box that says "hello" in the center of the screen.  Hello is the name of your job.  After selecting your job click the + sign in the upper right to kickoff the job.
